Ansible Master Installation:-Method 1.


1.	Create Redhat EC2 instance for demo, one is for Ansible Master 
2.	SSH your Master instance (1st Instance)->login as ec2-user 
3.	sudo su -
4.	yum update -y
5.	yum install python3.8   # ansible need min 3.7 version of python
6   python3.8 --version  # to check python version....min python 3.7 version is required for ansible.
7.	pip3.8 install ansible
8.	Check for Ansible version ansible --version (if you can’t see any ansible version then uninstall the ansible package pip3 uninstall ansible, exit from root user then type sudo su - and reinstall pip3 install ansible)
9.	Now create a directory mkdir -p /etc/ansible and change your directory cd /etc/ansible
    
10.	Create public/private rsa key ssh-keygen -t rsa and you need to Enter 3-4 times when asked.
11.	Check for ssh key cd /root/.ssh   
12.	View the key cat id_rsa.pub
13  SSH Ansible Node Machine (2nd Instance) user name ec2-user then sudo su -
16.	Change your path and open authorized_keys file vi /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
17.	Copy id_rsa.pub key from Master node (1st Instance) and paste in Ansible Node (2nd Instance) authorized_keys file at last vi /root/.ssh/authorized_keys 
(Don’t delete anything from the file)

18.	On Ansible Node instance (2nd Instance) we need to allow PermitRootLogin 

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Search for /PermitRootLogin and uncomment
Once you uncomment then restart sshd service   
service sshd restart

19.	Now you can access your client instance from Ansible Master 
ssh <private ip of ansible node>

20.	If you are able to ssh Ansible Node VM from Ansible Master then you are good to go,
exit from Ansible node terminal by typing below command
exit                                                                                                    

21.	If we run ansible <private ip of ansible node> -m ping        (Ansible Master)
   We will get error warnings, because hosts file is empty. To fix these warnings, please follow below steps.
   
22.In real projects, we have 1000 nodes then we create host file/inventory file.
Ping is the module.copy is also module.In playbook we have to use modules.100s of modules.
To check my instances we are getting warning as no invenoty files.
Every master server we have inventory in that all node information will be there.

22.	We need to create groups, go to Master Node, 
cd /etc/ansible and list files ll and update the Ansible Node information in hosts file                                                      
   
cd /etc/ansible
vi hosts
[amazonweb]  #there should not be any space
<private ip of ansible node> or <alias> or <dns >or <public ip>
   
   
Then run command as 

ansible <public ip/private ip/all/<the name of group u created in host file> -m ping   or


ansible 192.11.28.11 -m ping     # this ip should be available in hosts file

ansible 192.11.28.11:192.11.28.51 -m ping

ansible all -m ping

ansible group1:group2 -m ping


suppose you want to club two groups in one group then

[group:children]

group1
group2

while running the command u need to mention as

ansible group -m ping

============================================================================

Different locations of ansible.cfg file.

Priority of ansible.cfg file.

ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable.
./ansible.cfg   from the current directory.
~/.ansible.cfg  file present in home directory.
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg default ansible.cfg file.

================================================================================

BASIC STRUCTURE

Nodes are managed by ansible master
we have inventory file to have information about nodes
we have ansible.cfg to have all setting like path to hosts file and all
and we have module (predefine scripts/program written in java)


k8 services:->
============
google k8 services
azure k8 services
amazon k8 services  (elastic k8 services)

k8 installation tool:-

minicube
Kubeadm

========================

Problems without K8s.

1.Container can not communicate each other.
2.Autoscaling and load balancing was not possible.
3.containers had to be managed carefully.

docker swarm used 11% in market share
K8 57 %

                      ********Features of K8************.:-

1. Orchastation (clustering of any number of containers running on different n/w)
means making cluster of vm container+on premises container+cloud container)
means combine all containers into one cluster.

2. Autoscaling(vertical and horizontal autoscaling)
3. Platform independant.
4. Autohealing
5. Fault tolerance(Node/pod failure)  # it always tracks pod and if it fails it creates a newone
6. Rollback
7. Health monitoring of container
8. Batch execution(means u can all task in yaml in manifest file )one time sequential.

Plesae note:-K8 directlly dont manage container ...it manages pod.
==========================================================================
                     ******Difference between K8 and docker swarm:->>>>>

*Features
*k8
*DS

1.Installation and cluster configuration:->
k8-complicated and time consuming.
DS- Fast and easy

2.Support:-

k8-can work with all types of container like Rocket and docker
DS- Only Docker

3.GUI:-

K8-GUI available
DS-GUI not available

4 Data Volume:-

K8- Only share within containers in the same pod.
DS-can share with containers in the same and different pods

4 Autoscaling

K8-Autoscaling(vertical and horizontal autoscaling)
DS-not available

4 Logging and monitoring

K8-Inbuilt tool present for monitoring
DS-use 3rd party tool like splunk.


Please note:-There is one tool competitor to K8 is Apache Marathon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

K8 cluster consists of master and Node/worker.
It is master -slave or client server architecture.
Cluster can be any of the below.

1 master + 1 node
1 master + multiple nodes
multiple master+ multiple nodes.

Under each node you can create number of pods,
containers are created under pod.
k8 communicate with pod only because each container has its different metadata and architecture.

cluster:->node:->pod:->container:-> Application running/application microservice

                                     * Minikube installation**
									 
1. AWS account
2. Select ubantu 18.04 and cpu  t2 medium having 2 cpu
3. now login as ubuntu
sudo su -
apt update && apt -y install docker.io  # no need to download only install as ubuntu already has it.
									 
now install kubectl
 

$ curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list 
$ echo "deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y kubectl

you can check version via kubectl version command


install Minikube
https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-minikube-on-ubuntu
and then start with below
minikube start --driver=docker

If the minikube installation has been done on the macOS, then to access the URL on the local browser, we need to do a few steps to get the service URL to work. Those steps are covered on this documentation page: -

Replicas Controller:-

Helps to run multiple instance of a single pod on k8 cluster for high availability.

we need more than one instance or pod at any time as any pod can be failed anytime.

load balancing and scaling.
when load increases new pods gets created and when decreses pods gets deleted.
new pods can be deployed across the nodes.

replication controller is older one and replace by replica sets
here under template section u need to put all details when u created yaml while creating the pod.
Rs specifies that number of required pods are running at a time.

apiversion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metdata:
   name: myapp-rc
   labels:
     app: myapp
	 type: front-end
spec:
  template:
  
	metadata:
	   name: myapp-pod          		                      
	   labels:                  
		 app: myapp           
		 tier: front-end      
									 
	spec:                      
	  containers:                  
		- name: nginx-container      
		  image: nginx 
replicas: 3

now

kubectl run -f <filename>
kubectl get replicationcontroller


kubectl get pods
u will see name of pods with rc

                                       ****replica sets
 replica sets require selector defination which tells what pods falls under it.
 
 it will consider even those pods which we created befor replica sets

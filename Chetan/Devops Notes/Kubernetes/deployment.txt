Deployment:->

suppose we have webserver which needs to be deployed in prod server.
you need to have many such instances of webserver running.
supppose new version of application on docker registry then u need to deploy on docker container seamlessely..
you dont want to upgrade all the instances all at once.you want to upgrade them one by one known as 
rolling update.
now if u get any issues after rolling upgrade then u should be able to roll back the changes that are recently
carried out.

suppose you like to do multiple changes in your env such as upgrading the underlying webserver version,
as well as scaling the env and also modyfying the resource allocation.
so u dont want to apply all changes at a once on all instead of that
first u want to acquire a pod first make the changes so that all changes rollled out together.

all these capabilities are in deployment.
containers are incapsulated in pod and then multiple pods are deployed using replica sets or controller.
then above that deployment on top of it.

so will create defination file same as replicaset but need to change the kind.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metdata:
   name: myapp-replicaset
   labels:
     app: myapp
     
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      env: prod
  replicas: 3
  template:
	metadata:
      name: nginx-2
      labels:
        env:prod
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx

kubectl create -f <yaml file>
kubectl get deployments

deployment will automatically create the replica sets. 

kubectl get replicaset
then it will further create pods
kubectl get pods.

u will able to see the name with replica and deployment

one command for all 3

kubectl get all

How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?
Run the command: kubectl get replicaset or kubectl get rs

How many Deployments exist on the system?

Run the command: kubectl get deployments or kubectl get deploy

Why do you think the deployment is not ready?

Run the command: kubectl describe pods <pod-name> and look under the Events section.

Create a new Deployment using the deployment-definition-1.yaml file located at /root/.
kubectl create -f <yaml file>

Create a new Deployment with the below attributes using your own deployment definition file.

Name: httpd-frontend;
Replicas: 3;
Image: httpd:2.4-alpine


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: httpd-frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: httpd-frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: httpd-frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: httpd-frontend
        image: httpd:2.4-alpine


OR

Use below command:

kubectl create deployment --help then
kubectl create deployment httpd-frontend --image=httpd:2.4-alpine --replicas=3
u can check by kubectl get deploy
